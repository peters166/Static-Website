            <p>
                Hello.
                <br/>
                I'm Peter, a student here at Brooklyn Tech attending my senior year. 
                Have been bowling for a long while for leisure, you can find more about it on the favorites page. 
                It started as a hobby I picked up to pass the time with my grandfather, eventually it grew to be something I enjoyed for myself.
                Personally looking forward to what will be done in Web Development this year.
            </p>
